# JavaFileEncryption_Project
Overview
The File Hider project is a file management system developed in Java that emphasizes security and user-friendly interactions. This application allows users to manage their files securely through features such as user authentication, file uploads, and storage management.

Key Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in using their email addresses, with an OTP (One-Time Password) verification process for added security.

MVC Design Pattern: The application is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, ensuring a clear separation of concerns that simplifies maintenance and scalability.
Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language for the application.
JDBC: For database connectivity and management.
JavaMail API: For sending OTP via email.
SQL: For data storage and retrieval.
